This is my mirror of the git repository of Xournal
(http://xournal.sourceforge.net).

Denis Auroux has finally decided to switch to git. For that reason I
am going to try to synchronize my changes to his, so we can our code
more easily. If you are looking for the old branches, they will be
incorporated here soon, in the meantime you can find them in here:
